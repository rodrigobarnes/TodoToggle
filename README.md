#Â TodoToggle README

## Overview

This is a first attempt at a simple TODO list handling in sublime text. The idea is to use plain files (e.g. markdown to store the TODO list and use conventions to manage the list.

Currently two functions are supported:

1. Toggle (mapped to 'ALT-T'): cycle the item through the lifecycle
2. Archive (mapped to 'SHIFT-ALT-T'): move 'done' items to the bottom of the file and tag as done with a timestamp.
